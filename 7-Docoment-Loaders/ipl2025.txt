The Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025 season was one of the most exciting and closely contested editions in the tournament’s history. With the inclusion of a 10th team for the second year in a row, the competition format remained a double round-robin, followed by playoffs including Qualifier 1, Eliminator, Qualifier 2, and the Final.

This year, the tournament started on March 22, 2025, and concluded on May 29, 2025. All ten teams displayed incredible talent, with both domestic and international players contributing to intense on-field battles.

The Chennai Super Kings (CSK), led by Ruturaj Gaikwad, had a solid season, finishing second in the points table. Mahendra Singh Dhoni, now a mentor, was often seen giving tactical advice during key matches, adding strategic depth to the side. Shivam Dube and Matheesha Pathirana were standout performers.

Mumbai Indians (MI), captained by Hardik Pandya, made a strong comeback this season, finishing at the top of the points table. Their fast-bowling duo of Jasprit Bumrah and Gerald Coetzee proved lethal during the powerplays and death overs. Tim David and Suryakumar Yadav were consistent with the bat, guiding MI to the Qualifier 1.

Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB), despite high expectations and a star-studded lineup including Virat Kohli, Glenn Maxwell, and Cameron Green, missed the playoffs after losing a few close games. However, Kohli continued to be among the highest run-getters of the season, proving his value yet again.

Gujarat Titans (GT), under Shubman Gill’s leadership, displayed resilience throughout the tournament. Youngsters like Sai Sudharsan and Mohit Sharma stepped up in big matches. GT made it to the Eliminator but lost to a spirited Rajasthan Royals (RR) team.

Rajasthan Royals, led by Sanju Samson, continued their excellent run from IPL 2024. Yashasvi Jaiswal’s explosive batting and Trent Boult’s precision bowling were key highlights. They eliminated GT in the Eliminator and narrowly lost to CSK in Qualifier 2.

The final was held at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad, with a crowd of over 1 lakh fans. CSK and MI, two of the most successful IPL franchises, faced off in a classic final. Batting first, MI posted a competitive total of 181/6 in 20 overs. Suryakumar Yadav scored a masterful 72 off 41 balls.

CSK’s chase started cautiously, with Gaikwad and Conway building a steady foundation. However, a late blitz from Shivam Dube and a crucial cameo by Moeen Ali took CSK home in a thrilling last-over finish. CSK won by 4 wickets and lifted their sixth IPL title, going one ahead of MI.

The Orange Cap for most runs was awarded to Ruturaj Gaikwad (675 runs), while the Purple Cap for most wickets went to Jasprit Bumrah (25 wickets). The Emerging Player of the Season was Sameer Rizvi from LSG, who impressed with his fearless hitting.

This IPL edition was also significant for its use of tech. The BCCI officially introduced smart stumps with real-time data tracking, drone camera replays, and player mic-ups during live matches, making the viewing experience more immersive for fans worldwide.

Social media engagement hit an all-time high, with over 1.2 billion interactions across platforms. Fantasy cricket platforms like Dream11 and MPL saw record-breaking participation, with prize pools crossing ₹100 crores.

As IPL 2025 wrapped up, fans were already buzzing about the player auctions for IPL 2026. Will Dhoni finally take up the head coach role? Will RCB ever win a title? Can young talents like Riyan Parag and Tilak Varma become next-gen superstars?

Only time will tell, but one thing is certain—IPL 2025 was a blockbuster cricketing carnival that lived up to its hype and left fans hungry for more.
